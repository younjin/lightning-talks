# Lightning Talks (of the Jinny variety)

## What is a lightning talk?

A lightning talk is a short (less than five minutes!) talk, with a Q&A period at the end. That's it.

There are some ground rules:
- There is a slide deck (uploaded to/created on Google Drive is preferred)
- The topic should be accessible to anyone
- The topic shoud not be a pitch for a startup idea

If you have any other questions, feel free to message me on Slack or [email me](mailto:lightning-talks@kimyounjin.com).

Here are several examples of my old slide decks: [Horses (and Induction)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1g0vFeiVBUbHxWBq3HNDm17tDSIRDtGVXGn9oXsTBgNE/edit?usp=sharing), [Hipster Fluids](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1--EuB3mNtmkevpdokaOpvMmatSCP4cv9zDdpgMIm7XQ/edit?usp=sharing), [EAT](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/191EocweCckBLDupQZ-YGK4ANYRX8_dwlhN4ugk1qlTQ/edit?usp=sharing).
